Building AI application that leverages RAG system design pattern provides a number of benefits, such as grounding the LLM response in relevant and up-to-date information, which will reduce the chances of hallucinations when the LLM essentially provides wrong information or irrelevant information. With retrieval augmented generation, you also have the benefit of reducing the amount of information that is passed as input into the LLM. This can...

Lesson 4 content: You'll now take the tools you implemented for the chatbot and wrap them in an MCP server using the standard IO transport. You'll use fast MCP, which provides a high level interface to build an MCP server. Finally, you'll use the MCP inspector to test your server. Let's get coding. So we're going to pick up where we left off with the last lesson where we defined two functions, search papers to go ahead and find papers o...

Pause the video here to take in the share size of what is being passed into the LLM. You will also notice that the system has recommended the homely room in five star new condo. Remember this listing. Now, this is a fun part. We're going to look at a technique that allows us to reduce the extensive prompt you observed before and reduce it by a few hundred tokens. You start this by importing the prompt compressor constructor from the LLM ling...

So these can all start to work together. And then we're going to start layering on additional primitives like resources and prompts. To really see this work at a much larger scale. See you in the next lesson. And don't forget, if you ever want to get out of the chatbot, you can always type quit.

Lesson 8 content: The MCP server you built and the reference servers you used can also be used with any other MCP compliant application. That could be an IDE for a desktop app or an agentic framework. Claude desktop is an example of such an application. In this lesson, you'll learn how to configure Claude Desktop to connect to MCP servers. Let's have some fun! So you previously seen how to build your own MCP servers and clients and use ...

If you ever want to get out of this chat, remember we can always type in quit. So make sure you run that and we'll see that we're all done here.
